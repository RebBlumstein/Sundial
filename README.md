## About Sundial
Sundial was created to provide a more configurable calculator for times relevant to Halachah (Jewish Law.) One of the problems we noticed was that the available Halachic times calculators don't always have every Shitah (Legal opinion) represented, and individual Poskim (Legal Decisors) may have their own opinion that may not be covered by existing applications. Perhaps this will even encourage the more professionally created Zemanim sites to update themselves! Nevertheless, you'll hopefully find what you need here, no matter what opinion you follow. We are Orthodox Jews, so the opinions relevant will be those that would be accepted within Orthodoxy. We will also try to keep the default settings as normative as possible, so those who don't know what opinion they hold like (or know for one issue, but not others) can feel confident in using this application.

### Some Examples (This will get a bit technical)
- Rav Berkovits of Sanhedria Murchevet, Jerusalem, Israel -last time I checked- is of the opinion that Halachic Shkiah is 3/4 Mil (using Sha'os Zemanios) before Tzeis, but that Tzeis is later than 3/4 Mil past visible sunset. This is a P'sharah in Rabbeinu Tam's Shitah to align him more with the Gra's kashya from the metzius.
- Is Plag HaMinchah to be calculated like the Magein Avraham, the Gra, the Ben Ish Chai...? (As of this writing, if you follow the Ben Ish Chai, you're out of luck!)
- Do you use regular hours instead of Sha'os Zemanios for everything, like the Terumas HaDeshen? (Most don't, by the way...)
- Some hold like, or wish to be machmir for, Tzeis of Rabbeinu Tam as 4 Mil after Shkiah. Here are several ways that this can be calculated:
  - To use Shkiah from Sea Level and add 72 minutes in Sha'os Zemanios.
  - To use Shkiah from Sea Level and add 90 minutes in Sha'os Zemanios.
  - To use Shkiah -taking into account elevation- and add 72 minutes in Sha'os Zemanios.
  - To use Shkiah -taking into account elevation- and add 90 minutes in Sha'os Zemanios.
  - To find the Solar Altitude Angle of 4 Mil after local Shkiah at Sea Level and use this Solar Altitude to calculate for other days.
  - To find the Solar Altitude Angle of 4 Mil after local Shkiah -taking into account elevation- and use this Solar Altitude to calculate for other days.
  - To find the Solar Altitude Angle of 4 Mil after Shkiah in Jerusalem -taking into account elevation- and use this Solar Altitude to calculate for other days in all other locations.
  - (By the way, in the Sha'os Zemanios examples, did we calculate those Sha'os Zemanios from Neitz to Shkiah, or are they fixed minutes? I guess we'll need to include another several opinions to cover those possibilities!)
  - (By the way, in the Solar Altitude examples, will we proceed to use this time of Tzeis to calculate Sha'os Zemanios? ...)
- As you can see, the list of possibilities goes on and on, which is why every Zemanim application designer has to choose just how many opinions they are going to include.
